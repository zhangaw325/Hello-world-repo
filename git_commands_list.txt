# git commands tutorial By Andrea Scarpelli:

#1. git clone https://github.com/zhangaw325/Hello-world-repo.git

#git status

#git add <file>   or "git add ." means add all files

#git commit -m "a meesage of the changes"

In this command, we can see author, name, email, etc, which maybe added in .git/config file

#git push

when I do the push, I had the trouble of failed to use https
the solution is to change in .git/config file: 

I changed the url to https://zhangaw325@github.com/zhangaw325/Hello-world-repo
